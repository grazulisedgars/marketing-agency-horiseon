# marketing-agency-horiseon

## Description

First bootcamp challenge - Horiseon Marketing Agency. The challenge begins with starter code and later is modified to make the website more accessible. Below I'd like to list some of the things I've changed:

HTML:

1. Changed sites title to Marketing Agency Horiseon
2. Added alt text to images for accessability purposes
3. Added breaks for clarity so it's easier to read the code

CSS:

1. Consolidated CSS code for benefits section into benefit-block
2. Consolidated CSS code for content section into content-block
3. Moved around CSS code so content wise it reflects HTML and follows each other (In my opinion better to follow the content)

At first when consolidating files I didn't understand why certain parts don't work but then I realised that I should add (i.e h2 or img extensions to my selectors to catch all the components)
